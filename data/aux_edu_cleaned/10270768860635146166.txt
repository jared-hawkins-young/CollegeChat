New reprographics contract awarded



Business Services is pleased to announce that Ricoh USA has been awarded a five-year partnership with UNC Charlotte to operate the campus copy/print program.

The agreement brings new equipment, updated technology and streamlined management of the campus printers and multifunction devices. Document handling will be noticeably enhanced, more productive and easier to execute, even for the first-time user.

In preparation for the Request for Proposals (RFP), Business Services conducted focus groups with faculty and staff from various University departments. Considerable student input was gathered about pay-for-print, scanning and document services through questions posed in the Atkins Library annual student survey. Conclusions from that groundwork informed the RFP. 

“Ricoh had the best overall bid based on pricing, their ability to meet our service requirements and their willingness to provide most of the ‘wish list’ items that students and departments want,” said Rick Torres, Reprographics program manager.

Changes to expect with the new contract include:

REPROS Document Center upgrades 

Business Services is working closely with Ricoh on the implementation schedule for the upgrades and enhanced services which will roll out in phases with full completion expected over the summer.
