Summer School? Youâ€™ll Have to Eat!



An all-DB meal plan is available for those attending summer sessions. Price is $212 for $212-worth of DB funds. Like other meal plans, this can be conveniently billed through student accounts.

For those taking two summer sessions [bless their hearts], the summer DB meal plan is good through both sessions (in other words, any unused funds from first summer session will roll over to the second summer session). However, Summer DB monies do not carry over into Fall semester.
