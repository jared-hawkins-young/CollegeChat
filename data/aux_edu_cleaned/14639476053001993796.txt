Save lives at the 49ers4Life Blood Drive

Calling all Niners! The American Red Cross needs YOU!

The American Red Cross and UNC Charlotte are working together to host the fifteenth annual 49ers4LIFE Blood Drive, from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Tuesday,  March 12, 2024 in the Popp Martin Student Union room 340.

At last year’s drive, students, faculty and staff donated 236 units of blood, enough to potentially save 708 lives. This year, let’s top that record!

Visit redcrossblood.org and use sponsor code “49ers4life” to schedule your appointment.

Visitor parking is available in the Union Deck. Blood Drive workers can provide parking pass validation if needed.

Everyone who presents to donate will receive a free long-sleeved t-shirt and — of course — their choice of snacks and drinks. 

A special thank you to all the UNC Charlotte departments and organizations sponsoring this year’s event:
