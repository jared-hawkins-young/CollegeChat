Help Fill a Critical Need for Blood Donations

The Red Cross and UNC Charlotte will sponsor the Summer Blood Drive from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Wednesday, June 14, 2023, in the Lucas Room, Bonnie E. Cone University Center at UNC Charlotte. Parking will be available in the Cone Parking Visitor Deck, and free parking vouchers can be requested at the donation site for those who need it.

Now all we need is for anyone able to donate to schedule an appointment.  In addition to the personal satisfaction of helping others, all donors will receive a digital $10 e-gift card to a merchant of your choice.

If you plan to participate in this important drive, please make an appointment now as this will really help us be better prepared for donors. Walk-in donations will be welcomed too. 

Also, we encourage you to use Rapid Pass to streamline your donation registration experience and save time by completing your pre-donation reading and health history questions on the day of your appointment.
