Vending prices increase on some snacks

A vending machine price increase on certain snack products took affect this week. Items such as Doritos, Regular Lays chips and candy bars went from $1.00 to $1.25 but prices on the ‘better-for-you’ snacks such as Lays Baked chips, Kellogg Cracker chips, Snyder Pretzels and Nature Valley bars did not rise. “Snack vend prices have remained the same for five years,” said Rick Torres, Auxiliary Services program manager for vending. “Our snack vending partner, Canteen Vending, has always cooperated with the University to keep prices down, even though vending prices in most off-campus locations were increasing. Canteen put off a price change as long as they could, but a spike in manufacturing and distribution costs now require this increase.” Torres adds, “Soft drink vending prices will remain the same.” For questions regarding UNC Charlotte vending services, contact ricktorres@uncc.edu
