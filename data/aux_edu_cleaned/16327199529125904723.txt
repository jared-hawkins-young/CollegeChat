What Happened to Yellow Cab?



During academic year 2009-10, PaTS and Yellow Cab had worked out an agreement to provide a discount flat-rate for trips within 2 miles of campus and guaranteed flat rates for certain destination points like the airport and the Amtrak station.

It was a great idea at the time.

Unfortunately, the City of Charlotte said Yellow Cab could no longer honor the agreement because taxi rates are set by and are under the authority of the City.

Yellow Cab is known for quick response to campus, and offers online reservations and fare estimating tool. But the deal between Yellow and green-and-white is no more. üôÅ
