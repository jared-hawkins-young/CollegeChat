49er ID Now Available for Samsung Wallet

UNC Charlotte faculty, staff and students may now set up their 49er ID in Samsung Wallet, in addition to Apple Wallet and Google Wallet. 

Using your 49er ID in Samsung Wallet allows you to take advantage of these features:

If you would like to move your 49er ID from your Google Wallet to Samsung Wallet, you must first remove it from Google Wallet. Once removed, simply select “Add to Samsung Wallet” and follow the prompts.

Haven’t set up your 49er Mobile ID yet? Simply download the Transact eAccounts app to get started, and once your ID is set up, select “Add to Samsung Wallet” and follow the prompts. Check out full instructions and FAQs.

If you have any questions or need assistance, please contact the 49er ID Office at 49erCard@charlotte.edu or (704) 687-7337.
