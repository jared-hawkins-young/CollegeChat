Thanks to the New Models!



Notice anything different about us? We’ve added more student faces to the aux home page. Many thanks to our student models, TaQuana Beanum, Joan Chamunorwa, Alexander Rentz, Karla Bennett, Joel Simpson, Jasmine Dobbin, Joshua Spence, Irvin Perez, Charlotte Cramer, William Davis, Heidi Rodriguez and Robert Wright. Their faces will not only be showing up on the Web site, but in print publications that will go to incoming students during SOAR.

Aux is planning another photoshoot in mid-April so we’ll need some more models. If interested, write to auxiliaryinfo@uncc.edu and put “aux model” in the subject line.
