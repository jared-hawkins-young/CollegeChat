Mail on Campus

Campus mail

Campus mail is any piece of mail that is to be delivered from one Campus Department/Representative to another Campus Department/Representative. These pieces can either be placed in an Inter-departmental envelope or may be sent in an envelope of your choosing. If the mail piece is not sent in an inter-departmental envelope, the mail piece must be distinguished as campus mail by placing the words “CAMPUS MAIL” in the upper right hand corner where postage would be applied.

All campus mail and interdepartmental mail must be separated from any items needed to be metered or have postage affixed to be mailed off campus.

When addressing campus mail, use three lines:

Typing the address directly on the envelope or affixing a label using USPS mailing standards will improve processing speed. Please type all words in the address line in CAPITAL LETTERS. Use a Sans-Serif Font such as (Arial or Helvetica). Use point sizes between (8 point and 12 point). If you have any questions please contact Mail & Package Services at 704‑687‑0383.

Interdepartmental mail

When filling out an inter-departmental envelope, please:

Departmental mail pick up
