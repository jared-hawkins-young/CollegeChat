Commencement Fair is around the corner



The Commencement Fair will take place 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., Wednesday, March 30 through Friday, April 1, at Barnes & Noble Charlotte in the Popp Martin Student Union. 

The fair is a convenient, one-stop-shop where graduating students can pick up their commencement attire. Get your cap and gown, regalia, stoles, honor cords, diploma frames, pictures, class rings, alumni gear and more!

You do not need to preorder your cap and gown, but you must bring your 49er Card to pick up. Honor cords will be available for purchase.

Doctoral candidates can learn more about ordering custom regalia on the Commencement website.

The last day to pick up your cap and gown is Saturday, April 30.
