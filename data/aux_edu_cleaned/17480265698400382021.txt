The thirteenth annual 49ers4Life Blood Drive will take place on Mar. 24, 2022, from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. in the Popp Martin Student Union, Room 340.

Each pint of blood we collect can help save up to three lives and will touch the lives of so many more. In 2021, the blood drive collected 187 units of blood, which can save up to 561 lives. There were 112 first-time donors!

Donating blood is a great way to pay it forward and make an impact on people in our community. 

Participants will receive t-shirts for donating and will be entered into a prize drawing.

This event is co-sponsored by Red Cross, the UNC Charlotte Red Cross Club, Auxiliary Services, Business Services, CRES, PaTS, Popp Martin Student Union, REPROS, Chartwells, Canteen Vending, Barnes and Noble Charlotte, Housing and Residence Life, Student Government Association, the National Society of Leadership and Successand Beta Alpha Psi.
