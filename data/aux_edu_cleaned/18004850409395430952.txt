Blast the line with mobile ordering





Last fall, Business Services and Chartwells launched Niner Diners mobile ordering for popular campus dining locations. 

Now nearly all campus retail dining locations offer mobile ordering, including Bojangles’, Subway, Wendy’s and Panda Express. Starbucks and Einstein Bros. Bagels are rolling out mobile ordering in the next couple of weeks.

To skip the line the next time you eat on campus, download the Transact Mobile app (available for iOS and Android), and select UNC Charlotte. Enter the promo code MOBILE49ERS to receive loyalty rewards.

The app accepts credit card payments and optional dining account funds. Students can use their declining balance funds to pay through the app. 

Niner Diners Mobile app allows you to select any open dining location, customize your order and pay ahead for pick up. The app will notify you when the order is ready. Walk up to the Niner Diners Mobile pick-up sign, grab your order and go!
