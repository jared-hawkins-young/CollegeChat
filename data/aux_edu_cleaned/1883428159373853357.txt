                                            UNC Charlotte Campus Shuttle Etiquette 101                                        


With classes back in session, we wanted to take a moment to remind everyone of some of the basic etiquette for the campus shuttle that runs all over UNC Charlotte’s campus. Please wait until exiting passengers have stepped off the bus before boarding. Campus shuttle benches are small-ish but the forward-facing seats are meant to […]



                                            Where to park your car if leaving it for the holiday                                        


Students and staff who need to leave their cars on campus over the Thanksgiving break should park in Lot 25, near Police and Public Safety. Resident student, commuter and F/S permits are all allowed there. Parking your car in the open lot closest to Campus Police HQ makes more sense than an isolated spot in […]

                                            Summer School? You’ll Have to Eat!                                        


An all-DB meal plan is available for those attending summer sessions. Price is $212 for $212-worth of DB funds. Like other meal plans, this can be conveniently billed through student accounts. For those taking two summer sessions [bless their hearts], the summer DB meal plan is good through both sessions (in other words, any unused […]



                                            What Happened to Yellow Cab?                                        


During academic year 2009-10, PaTS and Yellow Cab had worked out an agreement to provide a discount flat-rate for trips within 2 miles of campus and guaranteed flat rates for certain destination points like the airport and the Amtrak station. It was a great idea at the time. Unfortunately, the City of Charlotte said Yellow […]

Visit any local retail department store and you’ll find racks of Carolina, Duke and NC State stuff with precious little, — if anything — for the Charlotte fan. That’s just WRONG. Maybe it’s time for some “positive reinforcement” for local retailers who consider the Green and White. If you see apparel or merchandise that proclaims […]
