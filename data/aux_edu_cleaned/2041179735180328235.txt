Summer Blood Drive June 3rd

The University’s Summer Blood Drive will be held at the Barnhardt Student Activity Center (SAC) in the Food Court area on Monday, June 3, from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. 

Schedule an appointment with the code “UNCC.” To save time, donors may complete their pre-donation reading and health history questions on the day of their appointment at the Red Cross’ website. Walk-ins are welcome, but you may experience a longer wait.

A limited number of exclusive Tetris and Red Cross shirts will be available as a thank-you gift for your donation.

The Summer Blood Drive presents an opportunity for the UNC Charlotte community and the surrounding area to contribute to lifesaving efforts. Each donation can save a life. We hope to see you there!
