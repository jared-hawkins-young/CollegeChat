49er ID Office moves to single 49er ID option for incoming Niners

Summary of what’s changing:

As of May 1st for incoming students and July 1, 2024, for new faculty and staff, the 49er ID and Meal Plan Office is requiring UNC Charlotte faculty, staff and students to adopt the 49er Mobile ID. 

Incoming students

Students enrolled in New Student Orientation (NSO) will receive instructions for how to set up their 49er Mobile ID using the Transact eAccounts app prior to coming to campus in their Canvas NSO module. 

All incoming students are strongly encouraged to submit their photos and add their 49er Mobile ID to their digital wallet before their assigned NSO session. View photo submission guidelines.

Staff from the 49er ID Office will be on hand to assist students and test 49er Mobile IDs at the Resource Fair throughout the summer.

New faculty and staff

Newly hired faculty and staff will be instructed to set up their 49er Mobile ID during the New Employee Orientation process. Any new faculty or staff member may set their 49er Mobile ID once they are assigned to a NinerNET account and have Duo configured on their mobile device.

Exceptions and lost or stolen cards

You are not required to adopt 49er Mobile ID if:

If your physical 49er Card is lost or stolen, you will be required to adopt 49er Mobile ID or pay a $20 replacement fee for the production of a replacement card. 

In the event that your smartphone is lost or stolen, you may deactivate your credential online at eAccounts.
