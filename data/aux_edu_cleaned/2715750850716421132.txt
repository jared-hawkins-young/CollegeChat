Bookstore

Barnes & Noble operates the Bookstore for UNC Charlotte, a partnership built on a commitment to textbook value that offers the best local selection of textbooks and supplies, plus:

Commitment to value

No-worry textbook returns

100% refund for textbooks with a receipt up to one week from the first day of classes; with a receipt and drop slip until up to 30 days from the first day of classes.

When returning Niner Course Pack materials, you will receive an email reminding you to return your materials if you drop a class. Materials must be returned by the posted return deadline. If you drop a class and enroll in a different class, you will receive an email reminding you to confirm your course materials for the newly added course and to return the material(s) for the course you dropped. The bookstore will exchange the required textbooks and/or access codes.
