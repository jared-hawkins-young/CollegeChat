Auxiliary Services is proud to partner with The WashRoom Laundry to bring laundry and dry cleaning services to campus.

Students, faculty and staff can use the on-campus laundry service via lockers located at North Deck level 1 and South Village Deck level 3.

Choose from multiple payment packages to best fit your needs. Special care instructions, hypoallergenic detergents and dry cleaning services are also available.

How it works

To get started, set up an account online with 49er Laundry using your phone number, email, and the Universityâ€™s address in the delivery address field (9201 University City Blvd., Charlotte, NC, 28223-0001).
