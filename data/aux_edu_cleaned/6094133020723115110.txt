Auxiliary Performance Criteria



The performance of both contracted and self managed auxiliaries will be reviewed routinely as well as formally on an annual basis. The standards for performance for contract providers are specified in the original Request for Proposal (RFP specifications), the vendor response, and the final contract agreement (which clarifies any inconsistencies between the RFP and the response of the successful bidder). These documents are maintained in the UNC Charlotte Purchasing Office, as well as by the contract administrator within Business Services. It is the responsibility of the contract administrator to insure the level and quality of service specified is provided. A staff person within Business Services is designated as contract administrator for each service provider.
