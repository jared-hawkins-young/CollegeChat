Show your Niner pride at College Colors Day

The Fall 2023 semester at UNC Charlotte is just getting started, and that means it’s almost time for College Colors Day!

On Friday, Sep 1, Charlotte students can celebrate the annual day and “Fan Out Loud” by wearing Niner gear and repping their school colors. Swing by Charlotte Barnes and Noble in the Popp Martin Student Union between 11am and 1pm for games, door prizes and light refreshments.

Plus, take advantage of 10% off purchases from the bookstore and B&N Charlotte online using the code PRIDE23.*

We’ll see you there in Niner Green!
