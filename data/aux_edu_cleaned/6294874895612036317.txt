Optional Dining Account

An Optional Dining Account (ODA) is a dining debit account that can be used at all campus dining locations, including convenience stores and SoVi Market + Bakery. ODA is available to all students and deposits can be made any time during the year. Unused balance rolls over from semester to semester, year to year, as long as the student is enrolled.

For any resident student, ODA can supplement a meal plan and may be used when declining balance (DB) funds have been spent. ODA is also a convenient choice for students who live in Greek Village or on-campus apartments and those who live off campus, too!
