Authorized Fund Code User Request Form

Copies and prints are billed to your department fund code used for printing and copying. If you do not see the correct fund code when you tap your 49er Card at the multi-function device, you or your department’s administrator will need to complete this form.

An authorized department representative must complete this form on behalf of student-workers to verify that they have permission to use a department fund code. Department representatives may enter one authorized user per form. You must resubmit the form to submit more than one authorized user.
