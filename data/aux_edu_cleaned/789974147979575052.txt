Win an iPod Touch and Cinco de Mayo Dining



Don’t run on empty here at finals! Refuel your Optional Dining Account with a deposit of $50 or more by Friday, April 23, and be entered to win an iPod Touch. Remember, ODA funds can be used at all campus dining locations, including Outtakes convenience stores. If you have money left on the account when it’s time to leave for summer, no worries, ODA rolls over from semester to semester, year to year.

Both RDH and Crown Commons will feature Mexican Cuisine in celebration of Cinco de Mayo (Wednesday, May 5).
