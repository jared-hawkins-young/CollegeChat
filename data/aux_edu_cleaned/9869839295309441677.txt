Student Parking empty space count report Spring 2014



“There’s no place to park!”

Really?

Spaces may be few in areas closest to the center of campus at the most densely scheduled class times, but there’s plenty of parking available elsewhere. Space counts, which are taken regularly, prove that UNC Charlotte has sufficient parking for visitors, faculty, staff, and students. Students are the population who most heavily use parking and for whom most of the parking is designated. The most recent space counts in student parking areas show an average of 29% of parking sits empty, even at peak scheduled class times.

Here are the numbers for Spring 2014, Monday – Thursday.* Italicized rows are areas that tend to fill at peak class times. Bold entries have the most parking to spare.

The take-away for Commuters:

Incentive to try parking at one of the least-used areas

The first ten permit-holding Commuters who park in one of the bold areas and Tweet a selfie of their car parked there, mention @unccpats and/or use hashtag #Iparkedfar, will win a deck voucher for one day of free visitor parking at Visitor deck. (Visitor deck areas are at Cone, East 1, Union, CRI 1 and South Village). That might be really nice to have for that day when you’re running late.

*Counts taken over a two week period of normal class schedule (no holiday/break).
